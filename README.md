# unicornhat-cpu-stats

Using Pimoroni's Unicorn HAT to show a simple colour gradient based on the CPU usage.

## Requirements

Obviously, you'll need Pimoroni's UnicornH AT for this to work. Installation instructions are found via [Pimoroni's GitHub page](https://github.com/pimoroni/unicorn-hat).

You can then clone this repo and run the Python code (requires `sudo`) and the Unicorn HAT will show a colour depending on what percentage of the CPU is being utilised.
